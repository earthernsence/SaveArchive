## Preface
The Save Archive for Antimatter Dimensions is now on a webpage! This was suggested to me by someone in the Discord server (https://discord.gg/9shqBCx) and I figured I would go ahead and create it. Thanks to all that have sent me a save (you will be mentioned further down after a few details), it's a big help!
